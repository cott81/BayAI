install stuff that is necessary to build this code

- cmake (was already installed in this container)
- libgtest-dev (for gtest)
- google-mock (for gmock) ... not working
- graphviz (for dot tool)
- gpicview (image view ... not working, can be removed)


gtest and gmock needs to be build in the container and symlinks have to be created
- googletest is installed in /usr/src
- configure it: sudo cmake . 
- compile it: sudo cmake
- create symlinks into /usr/lib: 
    sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libgtest.a /usr/src/googletest/lib/libgtest.a 
   sudo ln -s /usr/src/googletest/lib/libgtest.a  /usr/lib/libgtest.a
